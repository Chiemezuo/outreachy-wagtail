## Introduction

👋 Hello everyone!! My name is Chiemezuo, but feel free to call me 'Mezuo'. I'm a Node JS and Django 🐍 developer based in Nigeria. I made it a goal to contribute to open source before my next birthday 🎂 , and Outreachy looked like the best opportunity for that. So much of what I use daily is open source, and I know I have a part to play in contributing 🤝. Wagtail's issue #8365 (Adopt generic class-based views across all areas of admin) caught my attention the quickest out of all the projects listed. And so far, I feel very excited 😄.

When I'm not coding, I like to clatter away my thoughts on a keypad or read a nice book 📖. I also love to exercise 🏋️, and do anything that helps me mentally unwind, and takes me away from a screen 💻.

For Outreachy, this will be my first time participating, but I've read and followed up with all their sessions to get a good enough understanding. I also realize that at the heart of all open-source communities is communication 📞. I really look forward to the upcoming weeks (and possibly years).
